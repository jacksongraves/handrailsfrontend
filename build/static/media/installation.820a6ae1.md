# Installation

The CLI allows you to manage changes to your project scaffold from your local machine. Think of it like Git or a workspace manager. Let's say you finish scaffolding a project, and have written business logic for several of your endpoints. Then, the team realizes it needs an additional API endpoint, or a new UI component, to support a new feature. Rather than re-scaffold the entire project (and potentially lose your business logic), the CLI enables you to pull only the scaffold changes that you need. The CLI also reconciles updates from **handrails** in terms of code design and structure.

**Note, the CLI is not yet publicly available.**
