# Overview

**handrails** is a software service for scaffolding lightweight to moderately complex JavaScript-stack applications. These could be as simple as a basic Express API or as complex as a MERN-stack app with multiple REST and asynchronous APIs.

The goal of **handrails** is to save your valuable time as the developer (or team of developers). Rather than hacking together solutions as you go, the idea is to start with a general set of specifications for the project, based on industry standards, and translate that into working code in a matter of seconds, instead of months. This frees you up to focus on writing business logic, rather than writing boilerplate and refactoring on-the-fly.
