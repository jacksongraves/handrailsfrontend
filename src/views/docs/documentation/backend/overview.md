# Overview

**handrails** supports a wealth of configuration options for an application backend. If your project requires a backend, a Node app will be scaffolded; because **handrails** is a JavaScript stack scaffolder, alternative backends in other languages (for example, Django in Python) are not supported. Cloud backends like Firebase are also not supported.

**APIs**

REST APIs are hosted in Express by default. Fastify, Koa, and Nest.js are being evaluated for future support. Asynchronous APIs (such as a WebSocket API) are not yet supported but are on the roadmap.

**Databases**

handrails.io supports MongoDB schemas initially, and future support is being added for MySQL, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL.

**More coming soon on this!**
